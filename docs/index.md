# Welcome!

This is the first & only student-run wiki of **Community Psychology**

## What is Community Psychology?

> Community Psychologists consider how communities impact the well-being of people.

### Some things we consider are:

- the well-being of communities
  - (*empowerment, activism, & social justice*)
- how communities shape the well-being of people <---> how people shape the well-being of communities
  - (*ecological models, relationships, healing*)
- what people understand about their own well-being & the well-being of their communities
  - (*participatory action research methods*)
- how people define and relate to their communities
  - (*diversity, marginalisation, cultural humility*)

### Common ideas that Community Psychologists build upon:

- liberation psychology
- pedagogies of the oppressed
- intersectionality (& Black feminist theories)
- social & feminist models of disability
- transnational feminism
- critical race theories
- arts-based methodologies
- social constructivism
- ecological systems models
- praxis
- reflexivity
